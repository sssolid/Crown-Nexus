## **4. Data Management & Integration**

### **4.1. Fitment & Product Data**
- **Fitment data must support numerous attributes** (beyond Year/Make/Model/Engine/Transmission).
- **Product attributes are extensive**, with **up to 100 attributes per product** that must be **searchable and filterable**.

  - **PostgreSQL JSONB** for flexible attribute storage.
  - **Database-specific indexing** for JSON fields to optimize query performance.
  - **Elasticsearch indexing** for multi-attribute searches.
  - **Domain-specific data models** using Pydantic for validation.

---

### **4.2. Customer Pricing & iSeries Integration**
- **Existing customers have accounts in the iSeries database**, where **their pricing is pulled dynamically**.
- **No direct link between iSeries and the Crown Nexus** for security.
- **Pricing & inventory data are stored in PostgreSQL** for **faster queries**.
- **Multiple discount structures**:
  - **Customer Type-Based Pricing** (e.g., Jobber, Export, etc.).
  - **Specific Product Discounts Per Customer**.

  - **When it occurred**.
- **Optimized for performance**:
  - **Batch Logging**: Stores changes in structured intervals.
  - **Differential Logging**: Only logs when values actually differ.
  - **Asynchronous Processing**: Logs are stored without slowing down the system.
  - **Structured logging** with JSON format for machine-readable logs.
