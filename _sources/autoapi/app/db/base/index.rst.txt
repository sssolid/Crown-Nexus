app.db.base
===========

.. py:module:: app.db.base

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   SQLAlchemy models import module.

   This module imports all SQLAlchemy models to ensure they're registered
   with the declarative base. This is particularly important for Alembic
   to detect models correctly when generating migrations.

   This file should be imported by Alembic and not directly by application code.
   The application should import models from their individual modules instead.
