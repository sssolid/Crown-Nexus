# Crown-Nexus Refactoring Guide

This guide will help you navigate and implement changes to the Crown-Nexus backend without prior knowledge of the project. For each refactoring task, it explains what needs to be changed, why, and which files to examine and modify.

## Error System Simplification

### What Needs Changing
The current error system is overly complex with:
- Too many exception types
- Excessive inheritance levels
- Redundant error codes
- Multiple specialized handlers

### Why This Change
- Simplify error handling
- Reduce cognitive load
- Make the codebase more maintainable
- Make error handling more consistent

### Files to Examine First
- `/app/core/exceptions/__init__.py` - Shows all exception exports
- `/app/core/exceptions/base.py` - Contains base classes and error codes
- `/app/main.py` - See how exception handlers are registered

### Files to Change
- Create/modify these primary files:
  - `/app/core/exceptions/base.py` - Simplify error codes enum
  - `/app/core/exceptions/domain.py` - Create consolidated domain exceptions
  - `/app/core/exceptions/system.py` - Create consolidated system exceptions
  - `/app/core/exceptions/handlers.py` - Simplify exception handlers
  - `/app/core/exceptions/__init__.py` - Update imports/exports

### Files That Will Need Updates
- `/app/main.py` - Update exception handler registration
- `/app/api/deps.py` - Update authentication exception usage
- `/app/db/utils.py` - Update database exception usage
- Various service files that throw exceptions

## Service Decomposition

### What Needs Changing
Several service files are too large and handle too many responsibilities:
- `security_service.py` - Handles auth, passwords, tokens, and more
- `media_service.py` - Handles uploads, storage, processing
- `cache_service.py` - Handles multiple cache backends
- `metrics_service.py` - Handles all metrics collection and reporting

### Why This Change
- Follow Single Responsibility Principle
- Improve maintainability
- Make testing easier
- Reduce complexity

### Files to Examine First
- `/app/services/__init__.py` - Service registration system
- `/app/core/dependency_manager.py` - How services are managed
- Individual large service files to understand their scope

### Implementation Approach
For each service to decompose:
1. Create a subdirectory (e.g., `/app/services/security/`)
2. Create smaller, focused service files
3. Update service registration
4. Update dependency injection

## Configuration Simplification

### What Needs Changing
Configuration hierarchy is overly complex with nested classes.

### Why This Change
- Reduce indirection
- Make configuration easier to understand
- Simplify access to settings

### Files to Examine
- `/app/core/config.py` - Main configuration file

### Implementation Approach
1. Flatten the hierarchy
2. Move settings to main Settings class
3. Update any computed properties
4. Ensure backward compatibility

## Middleware Simplification

### What Needs Changing
Middleware stack has overlapping responsibilities and complex implementation.

### Why This Change
- Reduce middleware overhead
- Clearer responsibility boundaries
- Simpler request processing flow

### Files to Examine
- `/app/main.py` - Middleware registration
- `/app/middleware/` directory - Individual middleware implementations

### Implementation Approach
1. Consolidate security middlewares
2. Simplify error handling middleware
3. Update middleware registration in main.py

## Database Access Optimization

### What Needs Changing
Database access patterns could be more efficient.

### Why This Change
- Improve performance
- Reduce database load
- Better handle large datasets

### Files to Examine
- `/app/repositories/base.py` - Base repository implementation
- `/app/db/utils.py` - Database utilities
- `/app/db/session.py` - Database session management

### Implementation Approach
1. Add optimized query methods to base repository
2. Enhance session management with connection pooling
3. Add performance-focused utilities

## Dependency Management Standardization

### What Needs Changing
Dual dependency systems create confusion and complexity.

### Why This Change
- Reduce complexity
- Standardize dependency injection
- Make code more predictable

### Files to Examine
- `/app/core/dependency_manager.py` - Custom dependency system
- `/app/api/deps.py` - FastAPI dependencies
- Sample endpoint files to see dependency usage

### Implementation Approach
1. Simplify dependency manager with decorator approach
2. Standardize API dependencies
3. Update service registration

## Additional Improvements

### API Response Standardization
- Examine `/app/api/responses.py`
- Simplify to core response functions
- Update response handling in endpoints

### Testing Framework Enhancement
- Examine `/tests/conftest.py`
- Add more powerful fixtures
- Support better mocking

## Implementation Strategy

For any refactoring task:

1. **Understand Current Implementation**
   - Examine the files listed in "Files to Examine First"
   - Trace usage patterns through the codebase
   - Run the application to see behavior

2. **Plan Your Changes**
   - Identify all affected files
   - Plan backward compatibility
   - Consider test coverage

3. **Implement Changes Incrementally**
   - Start with core files
   - Update dependent files
   - Run tests frequently

4. **Verify Changes**
   - Run all tests
   - Check for regressions
   - Manually test key functionality
