"""
Models package.

This module serves as the entry point to the models package.
It should NOT import any models directly to avoid circular imports.
"""

# Keep this file empty to avoid circular imports.
# Import models directly from their modules instead:
# from app.models.product import Product
# from app.models.user import User
# etc.
