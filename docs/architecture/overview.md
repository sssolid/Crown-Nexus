# Crown Nexus Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

Crown Nexus uses a modern, scalable architecture with the following key components:

### Backend (FastAPI & PostgreSQL)

- **Framework**: FastAPI for native async support and automatic API documentation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy async ORM
- **Search Engine**: Elasticsearch for high-performance product & fitment searches
- **Caching**: Redis for caching frequently accessed data
- **Task Processing**: Asyncio-based task queues for background tasks

### Frontend (Vue.js)

- **Framework**: Vue 3 + Vite
- **State Management**: Pinia
- **UI Framework**: Vuetify
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript with strict type checking

### Infrastructure

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Pulumi with Python
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus & Grafana
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry

## Data Flow

1. Clients interact with the frontend application or directly with the API
2. Authentication is handled via JWT tokens
3. API requests are processed by the FastAPI backend
4. Data is stored in PostgreSQL and indexed in Elasticsearch
5. Background tasks are processed asynchronously
6. Real-time inventory data is synced from the iSeries database

## Security Architecture

- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 / JWT
- **Authorization**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Transport Security**: TLS 1.3
- **API Security**: Rate limiting and action auditing
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest for sensitive data

## Deployment Architecture

The system is initially deployed as a self-hosted solution with the following components:

- **Application Servers**: Running the FastAPI backend
- **Frontend**: Static files served via CDN or web server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL cluster
- **Search**: Elasticsearch cluster
- **Cache**: Redis cluster
- **Load Balancer**: For distributing traffic

Future implementations will consider cloud-based deployment with multi-region hosting.
